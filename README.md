# Home Service OnDemand
>The app addresses homeownerâ€™s needs for on demand  home services.  It  allows users to connect with services providers such as plumbers, electricians, locksmiths, among others. The app allows three different types of users: the administrator, the service providers and the homeowners. The administrator adds services to be offered to homeowners. The service provider creates a profile and selects the category applying to the services he (she) offers. The homeowners can search for a specific service provider or see the list of all the service providers within a category.
